## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties with SaSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap framework

### What I learned

Personally, I learned a lot from this project. My biggest takeaway was figuring out the steps to code a responsive web page.

Plus, using SASS with Bootstrap and keeping my styles organized made it way easier to manage everything, stay consistent, and work faster.

And of course, I got to try out different approaches to styling too!

### Useful resources
